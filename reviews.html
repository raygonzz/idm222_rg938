            <p>Did a wonderful job with my 6ft vinyl privacy fence. The whole transaction went super smooth. The estimation process was very quick and easy and from contract to job’s end our fence was up in less than 2 days. Great workers!</p>

            <p>Ray and his team did an outstanding job. They responded promptly to multiple requests for various designs. They completed the installation ahead of schedule and the end result is amazing! A beautifully crafted wooden fence.</p>

            <p>Installed a high vinyl fence in my yard. Removed old wooden fence, installed new and hauled away. Overall, a well-done job and good communication.</p>

            <p>This Wednesday during our food distribution our supply truck caught the edge of the gate when leaving the premises. We share the parking lot with Nazarene Baptist Church, our landlord, who recommended that we call Bergo Fencing because they had done a superb repair on another section of the fence that had been hit by an inebriated driver last year. <br>
 <br>To this day you can’t even tell where that accident occurred, the entire fence looks exactly as it was before.<br>
 <br>So we called Bergo Fencing on Wednesday afternoon,  they came out on Thursday and gave us a great estimate, with a small discount as we are a non profit.<br>
 <br>The work team came out Friday morning and by the afternoon our fence was repaired. Quality work, reasonably priced, immediate service. We highly recommend Bergo Fencing!</p>
